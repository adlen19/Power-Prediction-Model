# Fuel-Prediction-Model
This model encompasses various data science techniques to arrive at a predicted value of fuel that a vessel may consume prior to the voyage.


Althouyght the end goal is to predict Fuel consumptions, the project is broken down into two parts just to ave a deeper understnading on how diffrent permutaion and combinations of attributes selected for prediction actually affect the prediction. 

Hence, you will bee two models:
Power prediction 
and Fuel prediction.
